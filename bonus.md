# Super Crazy Bonus Release

Edit this file to answer the following questions. Give examples. You may need to do a bit of research. :)

1. Why is Hash.fetch useful?
Using #fetch helps "ensure that the given key exists in a hash (or array). This can eliminate confusing NoMethodErrors later in the code"

"You can use the optional block argument to #fetch to either return an alternate value, or to take some arbitrary action when a value is missing"

2. What is the disadvantage of single inheritance, and what's a possible solution to that problem?

"over time the requirements changed, and things that are common from our original perspective may be not common when viewed by a new perspective. Now everything that depends on the common interface have to be rewrite..."

3. Why are these classes initialized with an options hash?

Because the input variables do not have to be provided in an exact order.

4. What is the purpose of the private keyword in a class? What does it protect you from and why is that valuable?

5. Why are concepts like encapsulation, single responsibility, and abstraction important? Now that you've been programming for a while, have you seen any advantages for yourself, or can you imagine them in the future?
